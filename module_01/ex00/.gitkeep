# Exercise 00: Show me your DB
# Turn-in directory: ex00/
# Files to turn in: Nothing to turn in
# Allowed functions: pgAdmin, Postico, DBeaver or any other tool of your choice

# Objective:
# - Find a way to see the database easily with software
# - The chosen software must be easy to file and use for the search of an ID

# This exercise focuses on setting up database visualization tools rather than code.
# Common tools include:
# - pgAdmin (web-based PostgreSQL administration)
# - DBeaver (universal database tool)  
# - Postico (macOS PostgreSQL client)
# - DataGrip (JetBrains database IDE)

# Use the setup from Module 00 or create your own database visualization solution.

# Remove this file when you add actual content to this directory
