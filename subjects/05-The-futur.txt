1Chapter I
General rules
• You have to render your modules from a computer in the cluster either using a
virtual machine:
◦ You can choose the operating system to use for your virtual machine
◦ Your virtual machine must have all the necessary software to realize your
project. This software must be configured and installed.
• Or you can use the computer directly in case the tools are available.
◦ Make sure you have the space on your session to install what you need for all
the modules (use the goinfre if your campus has it)
◦ You must have everything installed before the evaluations
• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be
considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
• We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
• Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git reposi-
tory will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done
after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.
• By Odin, by Thor ! Use your brain !!!
2Chapter II
Introductions
Data Scientists often use tools such as techno python, Jupyter Notebook, Julia ...
It is up to you to find the tools that suit you. You are free to use any language of
your choice for this module.
The role of the data scientist is to predict "the future" with automatic learning models
on past data, he must be a force of proposal to explain the possible interest to the
implementation of his models, create tools to help decision making.

Exercise 00
Exercise 00
Exercice 00 : Confusion Matrix
Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in : Confusion_Matrix.*
Allowed functions : lib to display the image only
• You have to do the calculations by yourself. But you can use any library to display
the graph
• Print and display matrix confusion
• You will have to re-use this exercice later on, so make sure you understand it. This
will be checked during the evaluation

For Exemple:
Perhaps you should rework your data with what you have seen in the
previous module if your answers are too far from the examples.

Exercise 03
Exercise 03
Exercice 03 : Feature Selection
Turn-in directory : ex03/
Files to turn in : Feature_Selection.*
Allowed functions : All
The data seems too Multicollinearity, you will have to make a Detecting Multi-
collinearity model.
There are a number of models for detecting the importance of variables (Lasso, Back-
ward Elimination, Step Forward Selection, ...)
But here you will have to use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
• Display the VIF of your data
• Keep only the features so that the VIF goes under 5, and display the features

Submission and peer-evaluation
Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your
repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double check the
names of your folders and files to ensure they are correct.
The evaluation process will happen on the computer of the evaluated
group.
